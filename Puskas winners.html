        <p>The FIFA Puskás Award is an award established on 20 October 2009 by the Fédération Internationale de Football Association
         (FIFA), at the behest of then-president Sepp Blatter, in order to award the player, male or female, judged to have scored the
          most aesthetically significant, or "most beautiful", goal of the calendar year.</p>
        <p>The award is in honor of Ferenc Puskás, the striker of Real Madrid during the late 1950s and the 1960s, and central member
         of the highly successful Hungarian side of the same era. Puskás is widely considered by many to be the most powerful and
          prolific forward European football produced in first-division football, and scored a once world record of 84 goals in 85
           internationals. He is one of the top scorers of the 20th century, with 512 goals in 528 matches.</p>
        <p>It is important to preserve the memory of those footballing greats who have left their mark on our history. Ferenc Puskás
         was not only a player with immense talent who won many honours, but also a remarkable man. FIFA is therefore delighted to
          pay tribute to him by dedicating this award to his memory," said Blatter at the inauguration of the award in Budapest.</p>
        <p>A panel of select FIFA and external experts select the initial 10 nominees.</p>
        <p>The public vote for their favourite goal on the FIFA official website. The top three goals to have earned the most 
        votes will be presented to a panel of FIFA Legends, and they decide the winner of the Puskas Award to be announced at FIFA’s
         The Best Awards ceremony in September.</p>
        <p>The time-frame for the first award was July 2008 to July 2009. The annual award was presented for the first time during the
         2009 FIFA World Player of the Year Gala on 21 December in Switzerland, with the Portuguese player Cristiano Ronaldo being
          the first (1st) prize winner.</p>
